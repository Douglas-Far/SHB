				"Due to the amount of grace and agility required to make the movements of this martial archetype, only the most dexterous can become a Nobushi, wich can only be found in women. Normally, nobushis can only be found in Sakura in The Home of the Spirits. The wifes of swordsmen undergo a rigorous training to be able to protect their villages from monsters attacks and ensure order, while the men go outside to complete missions delivered by the chief. However, there are women who left their home in Sakura, and are willing to teach the fighting style of the Nobushis to young girls."
