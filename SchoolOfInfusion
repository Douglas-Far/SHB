They believe that it is strongest when it has been imbued into other objects as a medium to deliver the impact of the spell. And what object can deliver more impact than a firearm?",

Whenever you make a ranged weapon attack, you can cast a spell you have prepared into the ammunition, but before you make the attack roll. The spell casted into the ammunition must have a casting time of 1 action, and it must be able to either target one creature other than you, a point in the air, or has an area of effect originating from yourself. On a hit, the spell triggers against the target. If the spell is an area of effect it triggers with the target at the center. If the spell normally originates from the caster, the target is the point of origination and the area of effect continues in the direction of the ammunition. The spells effect triggers before the damage of the ammunition is applied to the target. If the the spell effect requires a dexterity saving throw, the target has disadvantage on the save."
